          <p class="text-content  ">The SeaKeepers organization offers various programs, including a citizen science initiative and 
            volunteer opportunities. Currently, the primary way to volunteer with SeaKeepers is through beach clean-ups, 
            which have proven to be very effective. While this is the main method of directly engaging with SeaKeepers, 
            the organization also makes significant efforts toward ocean conservation through their expeditions.

              <div class="label">Expand Reach and Awareness</div>
              <p>Nonprofits like the SeaKeepers, whose primary focus is ocean conservation, help raise awareness about the importance of 
                the issue among those who collaborate with them, whether through volunteering or partnerships. 
                They bring attention to climate change and its effects on the ocean through their ongoing efforts.

          <p>
            Through their programs, they provide access to places and areas that most people would not be able to visit or even know about. 
            One of their most accessible programs is their volunteer initiatives, anyone can join and 
            participate in their weekly beach cleanups to contribute to a cleaner community.

          <p>SeaKeepers educational outreach program, that is targeted toward elementary
            to highschool students, also contribute to potentionally
            creating environmental advocates along with their other programs that involve
            people who may not have been as knowledgable on ocean conservation. These programs not only raise awareness 
            but also foster a personal connection to the cause,inspiring volunteers, students,
            and community members to become long-term advocates for the environment.
