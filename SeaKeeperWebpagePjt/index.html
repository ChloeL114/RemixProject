              SeaKeepers Efforts
              <span class="popuptext">
                The SeaKeepers organization offers various programs, including a citizen science initiative and 
                volunteer opportunities. Currently, the primary way to volunteer with SeaKeepers is through beach clean-ups, 
                which have proven to be very effective. While this is the main method of directly engaging with SeaKeepers, 
                the organization also makes significant efforts toward ocean conservation through their expeditions.

              Enhancing Awareness and Reach Through Art
              <span class="popuptext">
                SeaKeepers, whose primary focus is ocean conservation, raises awareness about the importance of 
                protecting our oceans through partnerships and volunteer efforts. They spotlight climate change 
                and its impact on marine environments through ongoing initiatives. Expanding into creative spaces, 
                such as the art community, offers a powerful way to visually communicate their mission and reach 
                audiences who may not typically engage with environmental content.
            
              </span>
            </div>
            <p class="text-content">In seeking to expand their outreach and grow their visibility, SeaKeepers can benefit from engaging with communities 
              beyond traditional environmental spaces. Our research identified the art community as a promising avenue for engagement.
              By collaborating with digital and traditional artist, especially those focused on nature and conservation, SeaKeepers can introduce ocean 
              conservation to broader and more diverse groups in creative ways.

              Improving Accessibility to Create Impact
              <span class="popuptext">
                Through their programs, SeaKeepers provides access to places and experiences that most people 
                would not otherwise be able to visit or even know about. One of their most accessible initiatives 
                is their volunteer program, which allows anyone to participate in weekly beach cleanups and 
                contribute to a cleaner community. By expanding into virtual formats, SeaKeepers can further 
                promote their cause to individuals who may not have access to in-person events. This would 
                make their resources more accessible and spark interest among a wider audience, interest that 
                could translate into meaningful action in support of their mission for a cleaner ocean.

            <p>One of the main things important for non-profits is how accessible they are to the public, whether it be 
              their programs or reaching out to them for interest, that is why an improvement suggested to SeaKeepers 
              is to expand their programs to gaming platforms such as Minecraft.

              Fostering Long-Term Advocacy
              <span class="popuptext">
               SeaKeepers can expand participation to these programs initiatives to volunteers through a tiered system.
               The more hours that a volunteer engages and build trust with SeaKeepers can allow them to become more important
               members of the organization.
               Additonally, the Green Marine Program could benefit from targeted expansion.Expanding the Green Marine Program 
               could also engage more yacht owners through eco-focused activities that reduce their carbon footprint and promote 
               conservation-minded boating.

            <p> SeaKeepers has two notable programs that aim to inspire others to pursue a greener way of living: their 
              Educational Outreach Program and Green Marine Program. While these programs target different audiences, 
              they share the same goal, to educate and encourage awareness of ocean conservation. By fostering a 
              personal connection to the cause, SeaKeepers hopes to inspire individuals to become long-term 
              advocates for the environment.
